## Description
This is a command-line based, multi-client chat application built with Java. The project consists of a server that can handle multiple client connections simultaneously and a client program that allows users to connect to the server and exchange messages in real-time. Messages sent by any client are broadcast to all other connected clients.

## Features
- **Multi-Threaded Server**: The server uses a separate thread for each connected client, allowing it to manage multiple conversations at once.
- **Message Broadcasting**: The server receives a message from one client and instantly forwards it to every other client connected to the chat room.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Demonstrates a classic client-server model using Java's `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: The client uses a dedicated thread to listen for incoming messages from the server, allowing users to send and receive messages simultaneously without interruption.
- **Dynamic Client List**: The server dynamically manages the list of connected clients, adding new ones and removing those who disconnect.

## Output
*Add screenshots here showing the server console and multiple client consoles interacting.*
