# Java REST API Client

## Description
This project is a simple command-line application in Java that demonstrates how to make an HTTP GET request to a public REST API. It fetches a random cat fact from the Cat Fact Ninja API, processes the JSON response, and prints it to the console in a structured format.

## Features
- **API Interaction**: Connects to a public REST API (`https://catfact.ninja/fact`) to fetch data.
- **HTTP GET Request**: Utilizes `HttpURLConnection` to perform a GET request.
- **Response Handling**: Reads and buffers the input stream from the API response.
- **JSON Formatting**: Includes a basic utility to format the raw JSON string for better readability in the console.
- **Error Checking**: Validates the HTTP response code to ensure the request was successful.
