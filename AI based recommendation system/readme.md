## Description
This project is a basic **AI recommendation system** implemented in Java. It uses a **user-based collaborative filtering** algorithm to generate item recommendations. The system suggests items to a target user by finding other users with similar tastes and recommending items they have rated highly. üßê

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements a core recommendation algorithm that finds users with similar rating patterns to generate predictions.
- **Pearson Correlation**: Utilizes the **Pearson correlation coefficient** to mathematically calculate the similarity between two users based on the items they have both rated.
- **Weighted Prediction**: Calculates a predicted rating for unrated items by taking a **weighted average** of ratings from similar users. The "weight" is the similarity score of those users.
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Recommends only items that the target user has not yet rated, ensuring novelty in the suggestions.

## Output
*Add a screenshot of the console output, which shows the final sorted recommendations and their predicted ratings for the target user.*
